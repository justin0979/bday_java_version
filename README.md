# bday_java_version
A simple java program of user entering birthday and program outputting day of week that date falls on and the user's zodiac sign.

To run, either 

./run.sh

or 

javac main.java     ( followed by )      java main

This program was a project for a software design class to help students practice making software with Agile techniques
(the Test-Driven Developement technique was used for this particular program, via Junit and Maven) and using design patterns.
I've only attached the java code so far.
